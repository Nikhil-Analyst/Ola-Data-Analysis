Ola Cab Service Data Analysis Project

**Overview**  
This project involves analyzing and visualizing Ola Cab Service data to extract actionable insights, improve operational efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction. The analysis focuses on key business areas such as revenue generation, booking trends, driver performance, and customer feedback.

**Objective**  
- To uncover trends and patterns in ride bookings, cancellations, and customer satisfaction.  
- To provide stakeholders with interactive dashboards for data-driven decision-making.  
- To optimize resource allocation and improve overall business performance.  

**Tools & Technologies**  
- **SQL**: For data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.  
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizing key metrics.  
- **Excel**: For exploratory data analysis (EDA) and basic data manipulation.

**Key Features**  
1. **Revenue Analysis**:  
   - Breakdown of revenue by vehicle type (e.g., Mini, Sedan, SUV).  
   - Identification of high-revenue time slots and regions.

2. **Booking Cancellation Trends**:  
   - Analysis of cancellation rates by time, region, and vehicle type.  
   - Root cause identification for peak-time cancellations.

3. **Customer Feedback Analysis**:  
   - Ratings distribution and segmentation by driver, ride type, and region.  
   - Insights into factors impacting customer satisfaction.

4. **Driver Performance Analysis**:  
   - Performance evaluation based on ride completion rates and customer ratings.  
   - Recommendations for training underperforming drivers.  

5. **Interactive Dashboards**:  
   - Custom-built dashboards for stakeholders to explore data dynamically.  
   - Filters and slicers for deeper insights into specific metrics.

**Results & Impact**  
- **15% reduction** in ride cancellations after identifying and addressing peak-time inefficiencies.  
- **12% improvement** in customer satisfaction due to targeted driver training programs.  
- Enhanced decision-making through real-time, user-friendly dashboards.
